# C.V. DTT
Working space to host the David Toro Triana professional profile, maybe an little geek solution, however is an interesting alternative to get an update *curriculum vitae* (always lose my Office version, Libre Office is not too fancy looking, GDocs not run in my terminal) 

If you have an real interest in the talent of FLOSS industry, you know that the ssh, git, vim, Markdown, Debian and LaTeX (...what a renaissane tool!) that bring to you the downloable pdf C.V. version ..are a good pool of tools, of a very seasoned Open Source newbie (I didn't like the LinkedIn ego show, although in good hands is a wonderful business tool!)
