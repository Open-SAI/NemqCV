## CV
Working space to host the **David Toro Triana** professional profile, maybe a little *geek*, however is an interesting alternative to get an updated *curriculum vitae* (always lose my Office version, Libre Office is not too fancy looking, GDocs not run in my terminal). 

If you have a real interest in the talent of the FLOSS industry, you know that **ssh**, **git**, **vim**, **Markdown**, **Debian** and **LaTeX** (...what a renaissane editing system!), tools that bring to you the downloable *C.V.* in format pdf of this repository, are an indicator of a very seasoned Open Source newbie (I never like the LinkedIn ego show... although in good hands, is a wonderful business network!).
